# Pre-work - *Light and Sound Memory Game*

**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: Ebunoluwa Aluko

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

Link to project: (insert your link here, should start with https://glitch.com...)

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [x] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Changed the color of the Start and Stop button to enhance the game.

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
I used Stack Overflow
 https://www.rapidtables.com/web/css/css-color.html 
https://www.w3schools.com/css//default.asp to gain more knowledge on CSS concepts 


2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
As a computer science student, I've come to understand and accept that when we code, we will face difficulties. Knowing how to overcome these obstacles is what makes whatever project we are working on better and makes the achievement worthwhile.
There were a few times when I ran into problems while working on this project. One of the smaller challenges I encountered was trying to place more buttons and adjusting the FreqMap property.

I've discovered that a good coder is always patient and eager to learn. Whenever I encountered a problem, I took a step back, took a deep breath, and reread the content. I've discovered that coding with a relaxed mind yields the best results.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
Working on this project has increased my interest and understanding of the significance of each programming language and how powerful they are when used together. 
I had a lot of fun working on the Javascript code for this project. It was nice to see functions, loops, and conditions come into play while working on this project for someone who is more proficient in Python and familiar with Javascript.
For someone who has been involved in app development in the last few months, my main question about web development is whether using other programming languages for web development affects the runtime or efficiency of the web application.
If we wanted to do some of the backend code in Python, would there be a significant difference between that and using Javascript, or would it be nearly the same? I also noticed that when we started this project, css, js, and html files were automatically included. Are these the only three languages used for web development? Or could we modify the files provided by Glitch and convert them to C++ or Python files instead?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

I would have loved to include a replay button if I had more time to work on this project. I'd make it so that this replay button can only be pressed once per round of the game. This, I believe, could be used in place of the game's three strikes policy.
I would also have liked it if there was a small demo at the start of the game to help the user grasp what the game is all about.
Adding more levels, each with a different theme or background, also sounds like a great idea. Another change I would have made is to add more effect when a user wins or loses. These extra features, I believe, will make the game more interactive and interesting for the user.
